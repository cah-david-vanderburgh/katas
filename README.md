# Vending Machine Kata
This project contains an incomplete model of a vending machine in code. Your task will be to implement the stubbed methods and tests and then implement another feature from scratch. Take a moment to read through the two files (`VendingMachine.java` and `VendingMachineTest.java`) that comprise the project and familiarize yourself with their contents.

You will notice that there are method stubs in `VendingMachine.java` as well as corresponding stubs for tests in `VendingMachineTest.java`. Do your best to demonstrate Test Driven Design principles as you implement these tests and methods.
